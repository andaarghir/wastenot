# WasteNot

Every year, 2.5 billion tons of food is wasted. It's a massive issue that affects the economy, the environment, and society - both globally and locally. Not only does the food itself go to waste, but so do all the resources used in its production, from water to land and labor. More than one-third of the world's food is lost or thrown away. 

We are a group of students fascinated by traditions from every corner of the globe united by the passion for good food. Thus, the initial idea of our team was to create a website that could help to emphasize each country culinary “rituals” which are slowly being lost because of globalisation and the increase in the consumption of processed, frozen, junk food and to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. 

For this reason, we decided to start our project development finding a way to emphasise the healthy and homemade food with all his traditional recipes. To do so, we analysed which were the causes of our main problem: people tend more and more often to dine out and use restaurants and bar deliveries. The percentage of working population has strongly increased in the last years and work shifts changed too; people have less time for cooking and therefore they often look for prepared or quick meals. For these reasons a solution must be found, and our web platform named “WasteNot” might be the answer.
